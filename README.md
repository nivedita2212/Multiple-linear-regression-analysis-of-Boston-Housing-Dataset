# Multiple Linear Regression on Boston Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform multiple linear regression on the Boston dataset using the MASS package in R. The Boston dataset contains information about housing in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts, and is commonly used for regression analysis.

## Prerequisites
- R (version 3.6 or higher)
- MASS package

## Results
Interpret the results of the regression analysis:

-Coefficients: The estimated effect of each predictor variable on the median home value.
-R-squared: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
-p-values: Statistical significance of each predictor.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of performing multiple linear regression on the Boston dataset using R. The model provides insights into the factors that influence housing prices in Boston.
